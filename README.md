Simple web application for me to learn RESTful api and AngularJS.

Nothing special for now, needless to say.

You have to follow instructions below before you start the app.

bower install bootstrap

bower install angular

bower install angular-route

bower install angular-bootstrap

npm install -g grunt-cli

npm install

npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
